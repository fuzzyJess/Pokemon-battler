Created as part of the Northcoders course

Pokemon battle game using Object Oriented Programming skills.

Pair programming with Joe Fuller (https://github.com/fuzzyJess/fun-pokemon-battler/commits?author=Joe-Fuller)

Used the inquirer library, build a command line application to enable players to fight a simple battle.

For those of you unfamiliar with Pokemon, you can think about it as people (trainers) who have pets (pokemon), that live inside tiny houses (pokeballs). Trainers can only hold a maximum 6 pokeballs.

These people are also a bit strange, and they get their pets into fights with other people's pets in the park for no reason at all...
